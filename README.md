# Mexican-Food-Restraurant
Scenario: You work at a Mexican restaurant and you need to create a program that
takes orders from customers. However, sometimes customers might enter invalid input
or make mistakes when ordering. To handle this situation, you need to use exception
handling.

Task: Write a program that takes the customer's order for a taco and sides. If the
order is valid, the program will display a confirmation message and the total cost. If the
order is not valid, the program will display an error message and ask the customer to try
again.
Here's an example of how the program should work:
Welcome to the Mexican Restaurant!
Please enter your order.
Taco (chicken or vegetable)? chicken
Sides (chips, salsa, or guacamole)? chips, guacamole
Drink (coke, pepsi, or sprite)? coke
Size (small, medium, or large)? medium
Your order:
Taco: chicken
Sides: chips, guacamole
Drink: coke
Size: medium
Total cost: $9.50
